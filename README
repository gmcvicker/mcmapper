First markup a genomesequence with ambiguity characters representing
the locations and alleles of every SNP. This script is currently
written in python (and is somewhat slow) and has hardcoded paths to
HDF5 files containing the hg18 genome sequence and the locations of
all 1000 genomes YRI SNPs. An output directory must be provided to the
script. The script writes a single ambiguity-code containing fasta
file for each chromosome. Currently indels are ignored.

  python mark_fasta_SNPs.py ~/data/hg18/seq_with_snps


Create a binary file that contains genomic positions of seed
matches. This only needs to be done once for a seed of a given length
(and a given genome with SNPs). For example, the following command
builds an index table of 13bp seeds:

  ./build_seed_index 13 chromInfo.txt seed_idx.13.gz ~/data/hg18/seq_with_snps/chr*.fa.gz


Calculate mapping uniqueness of reads starting at every possible genomic
position. This needs to be done once for each read length. This program
writes a single wiggle file per chromosome containing the following integer
codes for reads starting at each position:
 0 - does not map (contains N, or overhangs chromosome end)
 1 - maps uniquely
 2 - maps to multiple locations
Example:

  ./calc_mapping_uniqueness seed_idx.13.gz chromInfo.txt 36 ~/data/hg18/mapping_uniqueness_36bp/ ~/data/hg18/seq_with_snps/chr*.fa.gz
